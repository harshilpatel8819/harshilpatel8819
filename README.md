# üí´ About Me:
Hi there! üëã My name is Harshil Patel, and I'm a React developer with 6+ years of experience in building responsive and dynamic web applications. I'm passionate about building beautiful and intuitive user interfaces that deliver a seamless user experience.<br><br>Over the years, I've worked on a variety of projects that have allowed me to develop expertise in a range of React technologies, including Redux, React Router, and React Native. I have experience with both class and functional components, and I'm comfortable working with JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.<br><br>In my most recent project, I was responsible for leading the development of a React-based web application for a large e-commerce company. I worked closely with the design team to translate their wireframes and mockups into a fully-functional application, and collaborated with the backend team to integrate the frontend with the API.<br><br>I'm always eager to learn new technologies and techniques to improve my development skills. In my free time, I like to contribute to open-source React projects and keep up with the latest trends and best practices in the React community.<br><br>If you're looking for a React developer who is passionate about delivering high-quality code and building great user experiences, please don't hesitate to get in touch. I look forward to hearing from you!<br><br>- Familiarity with component-driven development.<br>- Proficiency with documentation tools.<br>- Experience with package managers.<br>- Familiarity with testing frameworks.<br>- Knowledge of performance optimization.<br><br>
